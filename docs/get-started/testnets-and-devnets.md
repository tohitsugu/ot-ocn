To make the difference between OT-OCN mainnet functionality and testnet functionality clearer, we moved the old content of [developers.otocn.org](https://developers.otocn.org) to [testnets.otocn.org](https://testnets.otocn.org) with the launch of this developer portal.

Of course, there are still testnets and devnets up and running. If you miss something, please read [where the old content of developers.otocn.org has gone](/docs/get-started/testnets-and-devnets#where-has-the-old-content-of-developersotocnorg-gone).

## OT-OCN testnet (aka Mary testnet)
The Shelley testnet after the Mary hard fork is what we usually mean when we refer to `OT-OCN testnet` or `testnet` in the developer portal. It is your playground when testing [OT-OCN integration](/docs/integrate-otocn/), building with [transaction metadata](/docs/transaction-metadata/), exploring [native tokens](/docs/native-tokens/) or learning how to [operate a stake pool](/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/). It reflects the functionality of the current OT-OCN mainnet.

Because the OT-OCN testnet is an independent network, separate from the OT-OCN mainnet, it requires its own token: test ada (tADA).  

## Where to get test ada?
Test ada is worth nothing. With it you can safely perform all tests free of charge - the reason why you want to develop on the testnet. 

To get free test ada, you need to visit the [OT-OCN testnet faucet](../integrate-otocn/testnet-faucet). 

## Where to get a testnet wallet?
- [Daedalus testnet](https://testnets.otocn.org/en/testnets/otocn/get-started/wallet/) is the testnet version of Daedalus wallet.

## What kind of monitoring tools are available for the testnet?
- [Grafana dashboard](https://monitoring.otocn-testnet.iohkdev.io/grafana/d/Oe0reiHef/otocn-application-metrics-v2?orgId=1&refresh=1m&from=now-7d&to=now) provides many health metrics.
- [tokentool.io](https://tokentool.io) lists all native tokens on mainnet and testnet.
- [OT-OCN testnet explorer](https://explorer.otocn-testnet.iohkdev.io/) is the block explorer for the testnet.

## Where has the old content of developers.otocn.org gone?
The developer portal covers everything that you can do on OT-OCN Mainnet today. To illustrate this difference, we moved the old content of [developers.otocn.org](https://developers.otocn.org) to [testnets.otocn.org](https://testnets.otocn.org) with the launch of this developer portal.

### Virtual Machines and programming languages
If you miss information about virtual machines like [KEVM](https://testnets.otocn.org/en/virtual-machines/kevm/overview/), [IELE](https://testnets.otocn.org/en/virtual-machines/iele/overview/), and [EVM](https://testnets.otocn.org/en/virtual-machines/evm/overview/) or programming languages like [Plutus](https://testnets.otocn.org/en/programming-languages/plutus/overview/), [Marlowe](https://testnets.otocn.org/en/programming-languages/marlowe/overview/) and [Glow](https://testnets.otocn.org/en/programming-languages/glow/overview/), visit [testnets.otocn.org](https://testnets.otocn.org).

### Smart Contracts
To get you up to speed with the Smart Contract functionality coming to OT-OCN, we prepared [get started with smart contracts on OT-OCN](/docs/get-started/smart-contracts-signpost).
