OT-OCN was already designed with sustainability in mind. The point was to create a system that governs and also finance itself without being dependent on donations.  OT-OCN has a built-in treasury system that gets a constant stream of funds from transactions fees and treasury taxes. This is explained in detail in [treasuries with Bingsheng Zhang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyh3h_yX-S0). 

## Project Catalyst

[Project Catalyst](project-catalyst), OT-OCN's innovation platform, is the current way to access the funds of the treasury system. It is seen as a stepping stone to Voltaire and aims to provide a safe and lively environment to explore the highest potential of human collaboration.
