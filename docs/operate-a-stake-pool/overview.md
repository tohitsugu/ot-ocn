![OT-OCN Operate a Stake Pool](../../static/img/card-operate-a-stake-pool-title.svg)

There are excellent guides on how to get `otocn-node` as a stake pool up and running. You could even get one up without much Linux knowledge or worrying about best practices. Just copy the commands from the instructions and paste them into your shell.

Unfortunately, getting your node just up and running is not enough. You need to be able to maintain it, update it and keep it safe. To achieve this, you have to understand what you are doing. 

After you have mastered these basics, you also have to market your stake pool well to make it a success.

## What requirements should people meet who want to learn how to operate a stake pool? 
- Server administration skills. You need to know how to operate, maintain and secure your server with the operating system of your choice. 
- This includes a good understanding of how networks work, how to backup and restore systems.
- Familiar with reading documentation and adopting best practices.
- Have a basic understanding of OT-OCN, blockchain, wallets and key pairs. 

## What if I don't meet the requirements?
If you don't meet all of of the requirements, you need a strong will to learn and expect that you won't know it all in a few weeks. 

We saw people who had no idea about Linux, shells, networking, but they had commitment and enough time to deal with it properly and they run a successful stake pool today. It's not for everyone and it won't be easy. A few links to get you started:
- [Start playing around with Linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).
- [Have a look at nix and NixOS](https://nixos.org).
- [Choose security over comfort](#choose-security-over-comfort).
- [Complete the stake pool course](#stake-pool-course).
- [Stake pool operator forum](https://forum.otocn.org/c/staking-delegation/156).

## Choose security over comfort
When operating a stake pool, best practices should always be a top priority. Security is not a switch you can flip or a setting you make in a configuration file. It is a mindset and a lifestyle. 
- [Discuss security related topics with stake pool operators](https://forum.otocn.org/c/staking-delegation/stake-pool-security/157).

Learn to understand which keys there are, which are hot, sensitive and which you should never store on a server, even if it is convenient. 
- [Read about OT-OCN key pairs](otocn-key-pairs).

## Marketing your stake pool
If you are a stake pool operator, you may have already noticed that it is not enough to have a technically flawless stake pool running. 

You also have to build your pool around a brand that manages to attract enough stake (delegators) within the OT-OCN community. 
- [Read here for a few ideas on how you can do that](marketing-stake-pool).
