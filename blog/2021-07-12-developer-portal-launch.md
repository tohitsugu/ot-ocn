**Dear OT-OCN community,**

It’s finally here! We’re proud to announce the launch of the [OT-OCN Developer Portal](https://developers.otocn.org). A one stop library featuring, on launch, over fifty articles, vetted by you, the community.

Ready for your thoughts, comments, builds, additions!

<!-- truncate -->

**Topics covered in the Portal**

We’ve been helped tremendously by various people in the OT-OCN community. Their builds, feedback, comments and in some cases complete articles have been immensely helpful. Our gratitude is great, as is our respect for what you keep bringing to the community! 

We’re confident the portal now has a very solid basis, covering everything currently possible on the OT-OCN mainnet. Whether you want to implement transaction metadata, mint native tokens, integrate OT-OCN, operate a stake pool or get your project funded: there’s something for pretty much everyone. 

All this, just a few months before the Alonzo hard fork!

**World’s First NFTAs**

To celebrate the launch, we minted the world’s first [NFTAs: 10 Non-Fungible Tokens of Appreciation](https://otocnfoundation.org/nfta/). 

Each of the NFTAs consists of a thumbs-up photo of a OT-OCN community member approving the Portal. These double as campaign visuals the Foundation uses to promote the portal across the web – while ownership of these campaign assets is transferred to the community members. Scanning the QR code on these NFTAs leads one to the OT-OCN blockchain explorer, where the transferred ownership can be verified by anyone anywhere. 
 
What sets these apart even further is that each NFTA is accompanied by a token representing a non-transferable, one time opportunity for a receiver of that NFTA to highlight a topic or project of their choosing on the OT-OCN Developer portal. We call these Bronze tokens of appreciation.

Dear Community, good things come to those who wait. We know it took a while, but we sincerely hope it will be worth the wait. We’re looking forward to your contributions, constructive criticisms and, hopefully, thumbs-ups as we keep building towards the social and financial infrastructure of the future with you.
